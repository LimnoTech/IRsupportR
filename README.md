The objective of this package is to compile and evaluate historic water
quality data to verify if the data supports impairments attributed to
toxics. In order to accomplish this objective, data from various
datasets are compiled and processed into one consistent dataset for
comparing to numeric water quality criteria. Exceedances of the water
quality criteria are determined and categorization reevaluation
decisions are proposed based on the implementation of an approved
decision logic.
