Description: The objective of this package is to compile and evaluate historic 
    water quality data to verify if the data supports impairments attributed to 
    toxics. In order to accomplish this objective, data from various datasets 
    are compiled and processed into one consistent dataset for comparing to 
    numeric water quality criteria. Exceedances of the water quality criteria 
    are determined and categorization reevaluation decisions are proposed based 
    on the implementation of an approved decision logic.
